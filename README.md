# TASK 1 : Rules in the Rule Book Written by Blood
**Objective :** To explore the methodology behind air crash investigations and learn how aviation safety evolves from past incidents. \
**Task :**
- Write a detailed report of the air crash investigation, the report should include:
- Details of the flight, place, time, pilot details and an introductory paragraph about the accident which occurred /was about to occur including the losses occurred.
- Explain in brief about the aircraft.
- Using the Swiss Cheese Model analyze the key contributing factors (technical, human, environmental etc.) and also explain how each of these factors (layers of the Swiss Cheese) accelerated the accident when aligned together.
- State the various theories and assumptions which took place during the investigation and also mention the reasons which led to the elimination/confirmation of these theories.
- Reflect on what lessons were learned and how aviation standards changed post-accident.

**Report :** \
I have reported on crash of American Airlines flight 965, crashed on 20th december 1995. \
