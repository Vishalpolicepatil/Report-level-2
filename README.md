# TASK 1 : Rules in the Rule Book Written by Blood
**Objective :** To explore the methodology behind air crash investigations and learn how aviation safety evolves from past incidents. \
**Task :**
- Write a detailed report of the air crash investigation, the report should include:
- Details of the flight, place, time, pilot details and an introductory paragraph about the accident which occurred /was about to occur including the losses occurred.
- Explain in brief about the aircraft.
- Using the Swiss Cheese Model analyze the key contributing factors (technical, human, environmental etc.) and also explain how each of these factors (layers of the Swiss Cheese) accelerated the accident when aligned together.
- State the various theories and assumptions which took place during the investigation and also mention the reasons which led to the elimination/confirmation of these theories.
- Reflect on what lessons were learned and how aviation standards changed post-accident.

**Report :** \
I have reported on crash of American Airlines flight 965, crashed on 20th december 1995. \

Complete the Simulink Onramp course. \
Download and upload both certificates as proof of completion. \
**Outcomes&Learnings :** \
I have completed the MATLAB Onramp course in which i learned the fundamentals of the *MATLab* \
**MATLab Onramp Course :** \
**1. Navigate the MATLAB Desktop and Editor :** I have learned to use the interface and write my own scripts to save and run your code. \
**2. Work with Variables and Arrays:** I have learned to perform both element-wise and matrix operations, as well as use built-in functions. \
**3. Import and Visualize Data:** Practiced for bringing data into MATLAB from external files and creating plots to visualize it. \
**4. Program with MATLAB:** Got an introduction to basic programming concepts like logical arrays, conditional statements, and for loops to write more complex programs. \
**5. Use MATLAB Documentation:** I have learned how to find information and help within MATLAB's comprehensive documentation. \
**6. Complete a Final Project:** Analyzing light from a star to determine its motion. \

# TASK 3 : Autonomous Flight Planning & Execution

**Objective :** \
To understand and practice autonomous flight mission planning using Mission Planner and the ArduPilot simulator. \
**Task :** \
1.To learn about the Heads Up Display (HUD)available in the Mission Planner.  
### Heads Up Display (HUD)
The Heads-Up Display (HUD) in Mission Planner is a critical component of the ground control station software, providing real-time flight data and situational awareness for operators of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), rovers, and other robotic vehicles. \

1.Airspeed (Groundspeed if no airspeed sensor is fitted) \
2.Crosstrack error and turn rate (T) \
3.Heading direction \
4.Bank angle \
5.Telemetry connection link quality (averaged percentage of good packets) \
6.GPS time \
7.Altitude (Blue bar is the rate of climb) \
8.Airspeed \
9.Groundspeed \
10.Battery status \
11.Artificial Horizon \
12.Aircraft Attitude \
13.GPS Status \
14.Distance to Waypoint > Current Waypoint Number \
15.Current Flight Mode 
### Geofence 
The virtual boundary that restrict the vehicle from flying into unsafe or restricted zone. 
### Types of Geofence
**1.Cylindrical Fence :** Circular boundary to restrict the vehicle. \
**2.Polygonal Fence :** Linear boundary that is useful to fly a vehicle into desired area and shape. \
